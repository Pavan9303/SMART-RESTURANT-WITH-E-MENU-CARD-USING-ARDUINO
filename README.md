# Smart-Restaurent-With-E-Menu-Card-Using-Arduino
***
### ABSTRACT
***
Today’s era is said to be the world of technology. So many efforts have been taken by
restaurants owners also to adopt information and communication technologies such as PDA,
wireless LAN, costly multi-touch screens etc. to enhanced dining experience. This projects
highlights some of the limitations of the project based and PDA- based food ordering system
and proposed the low cost touch screen based Restaurant Management System using an android
Smartphone or tablet as a solution. The system consists of a Smartphone/tablet at the customer
table contains the android application with all the menu details. The customer tablet, kitchen
display connects directly with each other through Wi- Fi. Orders made by the customers will
be instantly reach the kitchen module. This wireless application is user-friendly, improves
efficiency and accuracy for restaurants by saving time, reduces human errors and provides
customer feedback. This system successfully overcomes the drawbacks in earlier automated
food ordering systems and is less expensive as it requires a one-time investment for gadgets.

### INTRODUCTION
***
The advancement of Information and Communication Technology has led to an increasing
number of industries to use electronic media and corresponding application for information
exchange. In the restaurant sector, Modern wireless device such as Personal Digital Assistant
(PDA) has been adopted into restaurant system to replace the conventional way of taking orders
using pen and paper. However, the PDA-based food ordering system has known limitations
such as the requirement of training of attendants, the need of having attendants to operate, the
inefficiency during peak hours and small screen size and the Multi touchable restaurant
Management System has limitations such as touch screens used are of mostly capacitive type
or resistive type which are costly. Hence by introducing an application loaded in an android
Smartphone or tablet containing the menu details these limitations can be overcome.
   
   Android is a software stack for mobile devices that includes an operating system, middleware
and key applications. Android boasts a health array of connectivity options, including Wi-Fi,
Bluetooth, and wireless data over a cellular connection (for example, GPRS, EDGE (Enhanced
Data rates for GSM Evolution), and 3G). Android provides access to a wide range of useful
libraries and tools that can be used to build rich applications. In addition, Android includes a
full set of tools that have been built from the ground up alongside the platform providing
developers with high productivity and deep insight into their applications.
   
   The project mainly aims in designing completely automated menu in restaurants with the help
of Android mobile phone using Wi-Fi module and an LCD to provide a user-friendly
environment. There is no need of a person to take the order from the table. The menu will be
displayed automatically on the customer mobile application using wireless Wi-Fi connectivity
and we can directly order the menu with the help of press on the menu.

### PROBLEM DEFINITION
***
We propose this integration of touch technology in restaurants based on android technology. It
is a wireless food ordering system using android devices. Android devices, in the past few
years, have reached the pinnacle of popularity and have revolutionized the use of mobile
technology in the automation of routine task in wireless environment.
   
   Our project is based on “Smart Restaurant with E-menu card”, which is very useful for home
kitchen, and it also dosen’t make any error like we do.
   
   The android application on tablets at the tables. The tablets will be provided to customers, at
their tables, allowing them to directly view the menu card and order immediately from their
respective tablets. The tablets are the property of the establishment and are kept at each table.

### OBJECTIVES
***
The objective of this project is to   

• Automate the whole restaurant system.   
• To make restaurants technology friendly.   
• To automate the reservation and billing system.   
• AI-Powered Phone AnsweringWhether the phone lines are filled answering simple   
questions or restaurants are too short on staff to answer the phone, restaurant owners are
losing sales everyday from missed phone calls. Automated phone answering solves this
problem with an AI answering the phone to assist guests with inquiries and orders. From
answering simple questions like “What are the restaurant’s hours?” to taking orders and
inputting them into the POS, AI-powered answering can help owners capture previously
lost revenue.This Soil Moisture product should benefit a wide range of applications and
users.   
• The main objective of this is to provide a budget friendly Smart restaurant   
• Self-Checkout   
• Automated Delivery

### METHODOLOGY
***
Each table in the restaurant will be accompanied with an android tablet or a Smartphone. The
device will be loaded with an android supporting application containing food menu details at
that restaurant.
All the above-mentioned digital component such as Smartphone/tablet
(containing menu app) controller another android phone (we used it for enabling hot-spot to
tether the wireless network) and Wi-Fi module are connected wirelessly to create a Wi-Fi
network.

### Advantages
1. Low power consumption.   
2. No need of a person to take order from the table.   
3. Long life.   
4. Highly sensitive   
5. Easy to install because of wireless interface.   
6. Usage of Android touch screen smart phone in performing the task.   
7. Can be used with any language.   # Smart-Restaurent-With-E-Menu-Card-Using-Arduino
